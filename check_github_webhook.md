# Check GitHub Webhook Status

## Good News: Commit is Pushed Successfully! ✅

- **Commit:** `87d6f3a` 
- **Time:** Just pushed (15:56:29 - a few minutes ago)
- **File:** `serverless/Dockerfile`
- **Status:** Successfully on GitHub

## Why Auto-Detect Might Be Delayed

Since your previous commits were auto-detected, the webhook should work. However:

### Possible Reasons for Delay:

**1. Timing Delay (Most Likely)**
   - Pushed just 5-10 minutes ago
   - GitHub webhooks typically have 1-5 minute delay
   - RunPod might poll every 5-10 minutes
   - **Solution:** Wait a few more minutes, refresh RunPod page

**2. Webhook Rate Limiting**
   - If many commits happen quickly, webhooks may queue
   - **Solution:** Wait or manually trigger

**3. Build Already in Progress**
   - If previous build is still running, new ones queue
   - **Solution:** Check if there's an active build

**4. Webhook Configuration**
   - Webhook might need to be re-verified
   - **Solution:** Check GitHub webhook settings

## How to Check GitHub Webhook

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings

Visit: https://github.com/MunthirCS/GenVidIM/settings/hooks

(You must be logged into GitHub as the repo owner)

### Step 2: Look for RunPod Webhook

You should see something like:
```
https://api.runpod.io/webhook/...
```

### Step 3: Check Recent Deliveries

Click on the webhook, then "Recent Deliveries" tab:
- Should show recent push events
- Green checkmark = webhook delivered successfully
- Red X = webhook failed

### Step 4: Test Webhook (Optional)

Click "Redeliver" on the latest push event to force RunPod to check

---

## Quick Actions

### Option 1: Wait & Refresh (Recommended if auto-detect worked before)
```
1. Wait 5 more minutes
2. Refresh RunPod console page (F5)
3. Check if build status changed
```

### Option 2: Manual Trigger (Guaranteed to work)
```
1. In RunPod console
2. Change "Build Context" from "." to "GenVidIM"
3. Click "Save Endpoint"
4. Build starts immediately
```

### Option 3: Verify on GitHub
```
1. Visit: https://github.com/MunthirCS/GenVidIM
2. Check that latest commit shows: 87d6f3a
3. Click on commit to see changes
4. Verify Dockerfile changes are visible
```

## Timeline

- **15:56** - Commit pushed to GitHub ✅
- **15:57-16:00** - GitHub webhook processes (1-5 min delay)
- **16:00-16:02** - RunPod receives webhook
- **16:02-16:17** - Build runs (10-15 minutes)
- **16:17+** - Build complete, test endpoint

**Current Time:** ~16:00  
**Expected Auto-Detect:** Should happen by 16:02  
**If Not:** Manually trigger to save time

---

## What to Look for in RunPod

### Signs Build Started (Auto-Detected):
- ✅ Endpoint status: "Building" or "Deploying"
- ✅ Worker count: Drops to 0
- ✅ Build logs: New activity
- ✅ Notification: "New build triggered"

### Signs It Hasn't Detected Yet:
- ⚠️ Status: Still "Active" or "Ready"
- ⚠️ Workers: Still 3/3 running
- ⚠️ No new build logs
- ⚠️ No changes visible

---

## My Recommendation

Since it's only been a few minutes since the push:

**Try this sequence:**

1. **Refresh the RunPod page now** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. **Look for any "new version available" notification**
3. **If nothing after 2 more minutes**: Manually change Build Context to `GenVidIM` and save
4. **This guarantees the rebuild starts** and won't break anything

---

## Verification Commands

You can verify the commit is on GitHub:

```powershell
# Check what's on GitHub remote
cd C:\Users\Admin\.cursor\Projects\FlowCharts\GenVidIM
git ls-remote origin main

# Should show: 87d6f3a... refs/heads/main
```

---

**Bottom Line:** The commit is definitely on GitHub. If RunPod doesn't auto-detect in the next 2-3 minutes, just manually trigger it - it's safe and guaranteed to work!
