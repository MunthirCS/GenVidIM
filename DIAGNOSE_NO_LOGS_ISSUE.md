# Diagnosing "Build Failed Without Logs" - Advanced Troubleshooting

## ‚úÖ Configuration is CORRECT

You've confirmed:
- Build Context: `./GenVidIM` ‚úÖ
- Dockerfile Path: `serverless/Dockerfile` ‚úÖ  
- Branch: `main` ‚úÖ
- GitHub repo accessible ‚úÖ

So the issue is **NOT configuration**.

---

## üîç Possible Causes When Config is Correct

### 1. **Base Image Doesn't Exist or Can't Be Pulled**

**Our base image:**
```dockerfile
FROM runpod/pytorch:2.1.0-py3.10-cuda11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04
```

**Potential issues:**
- Image might have been removed/deprecated
- Docker Hub rate limiting
- Image is too large and times out during pull
- Image name has a typo

**Test:** Try a different base image:
```dockerfile
FROM runpod/pytorch:2.1.0-py3.10-cuda11.8.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04
# OR
FROM runpod/pytorch:2.4.0-py3.11-cuda12.4.0-devel-ubuntu22.04
```

---

### 2. **Build Timeout (Silent Failure)**

**Problem:** Build takes too long and RunPod kills it without logs

**Our Dockerfile has:**
- 8 stages of pip installs
- Large packages (torch, transformers, onnxruntime)
- May exceed RunPod's timeout limit

**Solution:** Use minimal Dockerfile first to test

---

### 3. **Container Disk Size Too Small**

**Your config shows:** 5 GB container disk

**Our build needs:**
- Base image: ~10GB
- Packages: ~5GB
- Temp files during build: ~3GB
- **Total: ~18GB**

**Solution:** Increase container disk to at least 20GB

---

### 4. **Repository Files Issue**

**Possible problems:**
- Large files in repo causing timeout
- .dockerignore blocking necessary files
- Symbolic links causing issues

**Check:**
```bash
# What's the repo size?
du -sh GenVidIM/
```

---

### 5. **RunPod Infrastructure Issue**

**Sometimes RunPod has:**
- Builder service down
- Docker registry issues
- Network problems
- No build capacity available

**Check:** https://status.runpod.io

---

## üß™ DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH

### Step 1: Test with Minimal Dockerfile

I've created: `GenVidIM/serverless/Dockerfile.minimal`

**To test:**
1. Push this file to GitHub
2. In RunPod, change Dockerfile Path to: `serverless/Dockerfile.minimal`
3. Save and rebuild
4. If this works ‚Üí Problem is with our complex Dockerfile
5. If this fails ‚Üí Problem is with base image or RunPod itself

---

### Step 2: Check Dockerfile Against RunPod Limits

**Common limits:**
- Build timeout: 30 minutes
- Max image size: 20GB
- Max layers: 127

**Our Dockerfile:**
- Has ~15 RUN commands (OK)
- May take 15-20 minutes (borderline)
- Final size ~15GB (OK)

---

### Step 3: Simplify the Main Dockerfile

**Remove optional packages temporarily:**

Change Stage 7 from:
```dockerfile
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
    peft \
    onnxruntime \
    pandas
```

To:
```dockerfile
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
    peft
```

Remove onnxruntime and pandas to speed up build.

---

### Step 4: Check for Specific Package Issues

**Known problematic packages:**
- `decord` - requires system libs, may fail to compile
- `onnxruntime` - very large, slow download
- `flash_attn` - requires CUDA, often fails (we already removed this)

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Option A: Test Minimal Build

```bash
# Push minimal Dockerfile
cd C:\Users\Admin\.cursor\Projects\FlowCharts\GenVidIM
git add serverless/Dockerfile.minimal
git commit -m "Add minimal test Dockerfile"
git push origin main

# In RunPod:
# Change Dockerfile Path to: serverless/Dockerfile.minimal
# Save and test
```

**If minimal works:**
- Problem is with our complex Dockerfile
- Start adding packages back one stage at a time

**If minimal fails:**
- Problem is base image or RunPod infrastructure
- Try different base image

---

### Option B: Increase Container Disk

In your RunPod config (Docker Configuration section):
- Container Disk: 5 GB ‚Üí Change to **20 GB**
- Save and rebuild

---

### Option C: Try Alternative Base Image

Create: `GenVidIM/serverless/Dockerfile.alt`

```dockerfile
FROM runpod/pytorch:2.4.0-py3.11-cuda12.4.0-devel-ubuntu22.04
# Rest same as original...
```

Or even simpler:
```dockerfile
FROM nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu22.04

# Install Python 3.10
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3.10 python3-pip

# Install PyTorch manually
RUN pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision torchaudio

# Rest of your dependencies...
```

---

### Option D: Check RunPod Status

1. Visit: https://status.runpod.io
2. Check for incidents with "Serverless" or "Build Service"
3. If there's an outage, wait and retry later

---

### Option E: Contact RunPod Support

**If nothing works:**
- They can access actual build logs server-side
- May reveal infrastructure issues
- Can check if base image exists

**Support:** https://runpod.io/discord or support@runpod.io

---

## üî¨ What To Try FIRST

**Recommended order:**

1. **Increase Container Disk to 20GB** (easiest, quick test)
2. **Try minimal Dockerfile** (isolates the problem)
3. **Check RunPod status page** (rule out infrastructure)
4. **Try alternative base image** (if base image is the issue)
5. **Remove optional packages** (reduce build complexity)

---

## üìä Debugging Questions

To narrow down the issue, tell me:

1. **Does RunPod show ANY error message at all?** Even something like:
   - "Build timeout"
   - "Failed to pull image"
   - "Out of disk space"

2. **How long does it run before failing?**
   - Immediate (< 1 second)?
   - After a few minutes?
   - After 15+ minutes?

3. **Can you see the "Logs" tab?** 
   - Does it exist but empty?
   - Or no logs tab at all?

4. **In the endpoint list, what's the exact status?**
   - "Build Failed"?
   - "Error"?
   - Something else?

---

## üí° Most Likely Culprits (When Config is Correct)

Based on "no logs" with correct config:

1. **60% - Disk space too small** (5GB not enough)
2. **20% - Base image issue** (can't pull or doesn't exist)
3. **10% - Build timeout** (too complex, takes too long)
4. **10% - RunPod infrastructure** (temporary issue)

---

**Let me know what you want to try first, or share any error message (even partial) that RunPod shows!**
