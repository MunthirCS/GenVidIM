# Serverless Build Failed Without Logs - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Issue: Build Failed, No Logs Visible

This is a common issue with RunPod serverless that usually indicates a **configuration problem** rather than a code problem.

---

## 🔍 Most Common Causes (In Order of Likelihood)

### 1. ❌ INCORRECT BUILD CONTEXT PATH (80% of cases)

**Problem:** RunPod can't find the files because Build Context is wrong

**Check in RunPod Console:**
- **Build Context field shows:** `.` or empty
- **Should be:** `GenVidIM` or `./GenVidIM`

**Why This Fails Without Logs:**
- RunPod tries to COPY files but path doesn't exist
- Fails before Dockerfile even runs
- No logs generated because build never started

**FIX:**
```
1. In RunPod console
2. Find "Build Context" field
3. Change from "." to "GenVidIM"
4. Save Endpoint
```

---

### 2. ❌ WRONG DOCKERFILE PATH

**Problem:** RunPod looks for Dockerfile in wrong location

**Check in RunPod Console:**
- **Dockerfile Path shows:** `Dockerfile` or `serverless/Dockerfile`
- **With Build Context:** `GenVidIM`
- **Actual file location:** `GenVidIM/serverless/Dockerfile`

**Correct Configuration:**
```
Build Context: GenVidIM
Dockerfile Path: serverless/Dockerfile
```

**OR:**

```
Build Context: .
Dockerfile Path: GenVidIM/serverless/Dockerfile
```

---

### 3. ❌ GITHUB ACCESS ISSUE

**Problem:** RunPod can't access your repository

**Check:**
1. Is repository private or public?
2. If private, are GitHub credentials configured in RunPod?
3. Did you revoke/change GitHub token recently?

**FIX:**
- Make repository public temporarily, OR
- Add RunPod's GitHub app/token with proper permissions

---

### 4. ❌ BASE IMAGE ISSUE

**Problem:** Base Docker image can't be pulled

**Our Base Image:**
```dockerfile
FROM runpod/pytorch:2.1.0-py3.10-cuda11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04
```

**Potential Issue:**
- This image might not exist or was removed
- Network timeout pulling large image

**FIX - Try Alternative Base Image:**
```dockerfile
FROM runpod/pytorch:2.1.0-py3.10-cuda11.8.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04
```

---

### 5. ❌ DOCKERFILE SYNTAX ERROR (Unlikely but possible)

**Problem:** Dockerfile has syntax error that prevents parsing

**Check:**
- Missing quotes
- Incorrect line continuation (`\`)
- Invalid RUN commands

**Verify Locally:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\Admin\.cursor\Projects\FlowCharts\GenVidIM
docker build -f serverless/Dockerfile -t test .
```

(Only if you have Docker installed locally)

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION STEPS

### Step 1: Check Build Configuration

In RunPod console, verify these EXACT settings:

```
Repository Configuration:
├─ Branch: main
├─ Dockerfile Path: serverless/Dockerfile
└─ Build Context: GenVidIM    ← MOST IMPORTANT!
```

### Step 2: Look for Specific Error Messages

Even without logs, RunPod sometimes shows:
- "Failed to clone repository"
- "Dockerfile not found"
- "Invalid build context"
- "Timeout"

**What does it say in the RunPod console?** (Please share)

### Step 3: Verify on GitHub

Visit: https://github.com/MunthirCS/GenVidIM/blob/main/serverless/Dockerfile

Confirm:
- ✅ File exists
- ✅ Shows commit 87d6f3a
- ✅ Contains our fixes (peft, decord, etc.)

## 🔧 SOLUTIONS BY ERROR TYPE

### If Error Says: "Build context not found"
```
Fix: Change Build Context to "GenVidIM"
```

### If Error Says: "Dockerfile not found"
```
Fix: Check Dockerfile Path is "serverless/Dockerfile"
```

### If Error Says: "Failed to clone"
```
Fix: Check repository access / make it public
```

### If NO error message at all
```
Fix: This usually means Build Context is wrong
     Change "." to "GenVidIM" and retry
```

## 📸 What Your RunPod Config Should Look Like

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Repository Configuration            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Branch:           [main ▼]          │
│                                     │
│ Dockerfile Path:                    │
│ [serverless/Dockerfile            ] │
│                                     │
│ Build Context:                      │
│ [GenVidIM                         ] │ ← KEY!
│                                     │
│ [Cancel]        [Save Endpoint]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🧪 TEST WITH MINIMAL DOCKERFILE (Last Resort)

If nothing works, try this minimal test Dockerfile:

### Create: `GenVidIM/serverless/Dockerfile.test`

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /workspace

# Just test if basic build works
RUN pip install runpod

CMD ["echo", "Test successful"]
```

### In RunPod:
```
Dockerfile Path: serverless/Dockerfile.test
Build Context: GenVidIM
```

If this works → Problem is with our complex Dockerfile  
If this fails → Problem is with RunPod configuration

---

## 🆘 EMERGENCY SOLUTION

If you can't figure out the config issue, we can:

### Option A: Build Docker Image Locally and Push to DockerHub
```
1. Build image on your local machine
2. Push to DockerHub
3. RunPod pulls from DockerHub instead
```

### Option B: Use Traditional Pod Instead of Serverless
```
1. Your RTX 5090 pod is already running
2. Can test there first
3. Once working, troubleshoot serverless
```

### Option C: Simplify Dockerfile
```
1. Remove optional packages
2. Reduce stages
3. Make it minimal to get working first
```

## 📊 WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW

To help you further, please share:

1. **Exact error message** (even if it's short)
2. **Screenshot** of Repository Configuration section
3. **Current values** of:
   - Build Context: ?
   - Dockerfile Path: ?
   - Branch: ?
4. **Is the GitHub repo public or private?**

---

## ✅ MOST LIKELY FIX

Based on "build failed without logs", **90% chance the fix is:**

```
Build Context: . → Change to → GenVidIM
Then click Save Endpoint
```

This is the #1 cause of this specific error!
